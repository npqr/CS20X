# Assignment 2: Birthday Paradox

Find the number of students in a class such that the probability that at least two students have the same birthday is greater than $p$ (as discussed in the class). You are allowed to use any language. Your program should input the required probability $p$ and return the number of students ($k$). You should submit a single zip package containing the source code and a README file that describes how the code can be run. You can do the project in a team with at most 5 members (including you).
